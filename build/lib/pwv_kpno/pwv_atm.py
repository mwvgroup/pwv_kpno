"""This module provides access PWV measurements for Kitt Peak and the modeled
PWV transmission function.

For full documentation on a function use the builtin Python `help` function
or see https://mwvgroup.github.io/pwv_kpno/.

An Incomplete Guide to Getting Started:

    To check what years data is locally available for:

      >>> from pwv_kpno import pwv_atm
      >>> pwv_atm.available_data()


    To update the locally available data with any new measurements:

      >>> pwv_atm.update_models()


    To determine the PWV concentration at Kitt Peak for a datetime:

      >>> from datetime import datetime
      >>> import pytz
      >>>
      >>> obsv_date = datetime(year=2013,
      >>>                      month=12,
      >>>                      day=15,
      >>>                      hour=5,
      >>>                      minute=35,
      >>>                      tzinfo=pytz.utc)
      >>>
      >>> pwv = pwv_atm.pwv_date(obsv_date)


    To retrieve the atmospheric model for a line of sight PWV concentration:

      >>> pwv_atm.trans_from_pwv(pwv)


    To retrieve the atmospheric model for a datetime:

      >>> pwv_atm.trans_from_date(date=obsv_date, airmass=1.2)


    To access the PWV measurements as an astropy table:

      >>> # All locally available PWV measurements
      >>> pwv_atm.measured_pwv()
      >>>
      >>> # All PWV measurements taken on November 14, 2016
      >>> pwv_atm.measured_pwv(year=2016, month=11, day=14)


    To access the modeled PWV level at Kitt Peak as an astropy table:

      >>> # The entire model from 2010 to present
      >>> pwv_atm.modeled_pwv()
      >>>
      >>> # The modeled PWV level only for November 14, 2016
      >>> pwv_atm.modeled_pwv(year=2016, month=11, day=14)
