"""This document defines functions for updating the PWV model for Kitt Peak.
Using locally available SuomiNet data, first order polynomials are fitted to
relate the PWV level at nearby locations to the PWV level at Kitt Peak. The
resulting polynomials are then used to supplement the PWV measurements taken at
Kitt Peak for times when no Kitt Peak data is available.

End user functions defined in this document include:
