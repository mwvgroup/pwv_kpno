Description: 
        
        pwv_kpno is a Python package for modeling the atmospheric transmission
        function at Kitt Peak National Observatory. It provides atmospheric models
        in the optical and near-infrared (7000 to 11000 Angstroms) for years 2010
        onward. Knowing the atmospheric transmission function is important when
        correcting ground based astronomical observations for atmospheric effects.
        Observed spectra are typically corrected using observations of a telluric
        standard star. pwv_kpno provides an alternative method that does not
        require dedicated observation time, and that can be run at the observer's
        convenience.
        
        When working in the optical and near-infrared, the atmospheric transmission
        function is highly dependent on the amount of precipitable water vapor (PWV)
        in the atmosphere. pwv_kpno models the atmospheric transmission using PWV
        measurements provided by the SuomiNet Project. SuomiNet measures PWV values
        by relating the delay in GPS signals to PWV levels in the atmosphere. This
        package uses measurements taken by GPS receivers located at Kitt Peak AZ,
        Amado AZ, Sahuarita AZ, Tucson AZ, and Tohono O'odham Community College.
        
        For more details on the correlation between GPS signals and PWV levels see
        Blake and Shaw, 2011 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6703). To learn more about
        the SuomiNet project, see their website (http://www.suominet.ucar.edu/overview.html).
