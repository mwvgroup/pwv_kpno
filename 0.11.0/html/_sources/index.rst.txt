********
Overview
********

**pwv_kpno** is a Python package for modeling the atmospheric absorption due
to H\ :sub:`2`\ O at Kitt Peak National Observatory. It provides atmospheric
models in the near-infrared (from 7,000 to 10,000 Angstroms) for years 2010
onward. Understanding atmospheric effects is important when calibrating
ground based astronomical observations. Traditionally, determining the detailed
atmospheric transmission function at a given date and time required performing
dedicated spectrographic observations. **pwv_kpno** provides an alternative
that can be performed at the user's convenience.

Atmospheric absorption in the near-infrared is highly dependent on the column
density of precipitable water vapor (PWV). By measuring the delay of GPS
signals through the atmosphere, the `SuomiNet project
<http://www.suominet.ucar.edu>`_ provides accurate PWV measurements for
multiple, international locations. The **pwv_kpno** package uses published
SuomiNet data in conjunction with MODTRAN models to determine the modeled
atmospheric transmission function at Kitt Peak in close to real time. The
package also provides automated retrieval and processing of SuomiNet data,
allowing photometry to typically be corrected within an hour of observation.
