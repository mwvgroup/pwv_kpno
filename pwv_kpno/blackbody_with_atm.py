"""This module provides modeling for the effects of atmospheric absorption
due to precipitable water vapor (PWV) on a black body.

For full documentation on a function use the builtin Python `help` function
or see https://mwvgroup.github.io/pwv_kpno/.

An incomplete guide to getting started:

    To determine the SED of a black body under the influence of atmospheric
    effects due to a known PWV concentration (in mm):

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from pwv_kpno import blackbody_with_atm as bb_atm
    >>>
    >>> bb_temp = 8000  # Black Body temperature in Kelvin
    >>> wavelengths = np.arange(7000, 10000, 100)  # Wavelengths in Angstrom
    >>> pwv = 15  # Integrated PWV concentration in mm
    >>>
    >>> sed = bb_atm.sed(bb_temp, wavelengths, pwv)


    To determine the magnitude of a black body either with (PWV > 0) or without
    (PWV = 0) atmospheric effects:

    >>> from pwv_kpno import blackbody_with_atm as bb_atm
    >>>
    >>> bb_temp = 8000
    >>> i_band = (7000, 8500)
    >>> pwv = 15
    >>>
    >>> bb_mag = bb_atm.magnitude(bb_temp, i_band, pwv)


    To determine the residual error in the zero point of a photometric image
    due to PWV:

    >>> from pwv_kpno import blackbody_with_atm as bb_atm
    >>>
    >>> reference_star_temp = 4000
    >>> other_star_temp = 10000
    >>> bias = bb_atm.zp_bias(reference_star_temp,
    >>>                       other_star_temp,
    >>>                       i_band,
    >>>                       pwv)
