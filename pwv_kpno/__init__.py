"""pwv_kpno provides models for the atmospheric transmission function due to
precipitable water vapor (PWV). Using PWV measurements published
by the SuomiNet project (https://www.suominet.ucar.edu), this package is
capable of returning the modeled PWV transmission for a given date, time, and
airmass at customizable geographic locations. By default, this functionality
is set to model Kitt Peak National Observatory. Default models cover
wavelengths from 3,000 to 12,000 Angstroms at a resolution of 0.05 Angstroms.

For more information on using this package, documentation is available online
at https://mwvgroup.github.io/pwv_kpno/ or through the standard python help
function.

An incomplete guide to getting started:

    To model the effects of PWV absorption on a black body, see the
    documentation for the `blackbody_with_atm` module:

      >>> from pwv_kpno import blackbody_with_atm as bb_atm


    To model the atmospheric transmission function, either for a known PWV
    concentration or for a datetime at a particular location, see the `pw_atm`
    module:

      >>> from pwv_kpno import pwv_atm


    To configure this package to model a custom geographical site, and to
    modify other package settings, see the `package_settings` module:

      >>> from pwv_kpno import package_settings
