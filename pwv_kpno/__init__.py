"""pwv_kpno provides models for the atmospheric transmission function due to
precipitable water vapor (PWV). Using PWV measurements published
by the SuomiNet project (https://www.suominet.ucar.edu), this package is
capable of returning the modeled PWV transmission for a given date and time
at customizable geographic locations. The atmospheric transmission can also be
determined manually for a given set of atmospheric parameters.

For more information on using this package, documentation is available online
at https://mwvgroup.github.io/pwv_kpno/ or through the standard python help
function.
