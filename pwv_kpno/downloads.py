"""The ``downloads`` module is responsible for downloading precipitable
water vapor measurements from SuomiNet servers onto the local machine.
Data files are stored downloaded to one of the following locations:

1. If a specific directory is specified at the time of download,
   data files are downloaded to that directory.
2. If the variable ``SUOMINET_DIR`` is set in the working environment, data is
   downloaded to the directory assigned to that variable.
3. If neither of the above cases are satisfied, data is downloaded into the
   installation directory of ``pwv_kpno`` package.
