Transmission Modeling
=====================

Transmission models in **pwv_kpno** are callable objects that evaluate the
atmospheric PWV transmission function for a given set of wavelengths and
PWV concentrations. Although it is possible to define a customized model
(see below), we here use a prebuilt model for convenience.

By default, transmission models are returned for a given PWV concentration at
the highest available resolution

.. doctest:: python

   >>> from pwv_kpno.defaults import v1_transmission
   >>>
   >>> pwv = 5
   >>> transmission = v1_transmission(pwv)
   >>> print(transmission)
   3000.00     1.000000
   3000.05     1.000000
   3000.10     1.000000
   3000.15     1.000000
   3000.20     1.000000
                 ...
   11999.80    0.995957
   11999.85    0.995927
   11999.90    0.995875
   11999.95    0.995805
   12000.00    0.995718
   Name: 5.0 mm, Length: 180001, dtype: float64


Notice when evaluating transmission models for a single PWV concentration, the
returned value is a pandas ``Series`` object. An array of PWV values can also
be passed to the model, in which case the return will be a pandas ``DataFrame``:

.. doctest:: python

   >>> vector_pwv = [5, 10]
   >>> transmission = v1_transmission(vector_pwv)
   >>> print(transmission)
               5.0 mm   10.0 mm
   3000.00   1.000000  1.000000
   3000.05   1.000000  1.000000
   3000.10   1.000000  1.000000
   3000.15   1.000000  1.000000
   3000.20   1.000000  1.000000
   ...            ...       ...
   11999.80  0.995957  0.991931
   11999.85  0.995927  0.991871
   11999.90  0.995875  0.991767
   11999.95  0.995805  0.991627
   12000.00  0.995718  0.991453
   <BLANKLINE>
   [180001 rows x 2 columns]

The transmission model can also be evaluated for a given set of wavelengths
by specifying the ``wave`` argument (in units of Angstroms). The returned
values are determined by linearly interpolating from the underlying transmission
values.

.. doctest:: python

   >>> pwv = 5
   >>> wavelengths = range(3_000, 12_000)
   >>> transmission = v1_transmission(pwv, wave=wavelengths)
   >>> print(transmission)
   3000     1.000000
   3001     1.000000
   3002     1.000000
   3003     1.000000
   3004     1.000000
   ...           ...
   11995    0.996006
   11996    0.994342
   11997    0.934950
   11998    0.987888
   11999    0.995811
   Name: 5.0 mm, Length: 9000, dtype: float64


Reducing Model Resolution
-------------------------

You may want to bin the resolution of the modeled transmission function to
match an existing data set (e.g., the SED of a spectroscopically observed
object). This can be accomplished by specifying the resolution argument.
Here is an example that visualizes the effect of the ``res`` argument:

.. doctest:: python

   >>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
   >>>
   >>> full_res = v1_transmission(pwv, wavelengths)
   >>> lower_res = v1_transmission(pwv, wavelengths, res=10)
   >>>
   >>> plt.plot(full_res.index, full_res, label='Default resolution')  #doctest:+SKIP
   >>> plt.plot(full_res.index, lower_res, label='res = 10')  #doctest:+SKIP
   >>> plt.xlabel('Wavlengths (Angstrom)')  #doctest:+SKIP
   >>> plt.ylabel('Transmission')  #doctest:+SKIP
   >>> plt.legend()  #doctest:+SKIP
   >>> plt.show()  #doctest:+SKIP

Defining Custom Transmission Models
-----------------------------------

The **pwv_kpno** package provides predefined transmission models as part of the
``defaults`` module. However, customized transmission models can also be defined
using one of the below options. Each available option represents a
different approach to how the atmospheric transmission is calculated for a
given PWV concentration.

Interpolation Models (Recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``TransmissionModel`` class determines the PWV transmission function by
linearly interpolating through pre-tabulated transmission values sampled from
a uniform grid of PWV concentrations and wavelengths. Here we demonstrate a
mock transmission model with transmission values that are uniform with
wavelength, but decrease linearly with PWV

.. doctest:: python

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> from pwv_kpno.transmission import TransmissionModel
   >>>
   >>> pwv_grid_points = [0, 4]
   >>> wave_grid_points = np.arange(6_000, 8_000, 100)  # Expected in Angstroms
   >>> simulated_trans = [np.ones_like(wave_grid_points), np.zeros_like(wave_grid_points)]
   >>> trans_model = TransmissionModel(pwv_grid_points, wave_grid_points, simulated_trans)

Cross Section Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``CrossSectionTransmission`` class determines the PWV transmission function
by evaluating the Beer-Lambert law for a set of per-wavelength molecular
cross-sections. Cross section values must be specified in units of
:math:`cm^2`. Wavlength values must be specified in units of Angstroms.

.. doctest:: python

   >>> from pwv_kpno.transmission import CrossSectionTransmission
   >>>
   >>> wavelengths = [3000, 4000, 5000, 6000]
   >>> cross_sections = [1.711160e-30, 1.711250e-30, 2.515410e-25, 2.567750e-25]
   >>> trans_model = CrossSectionTransmission(wavelengths, cross_sections)
